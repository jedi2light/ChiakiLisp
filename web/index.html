                        ChiakiLisp - is an experimental project
                        aimed to play around LISP interpreter implementation.
                        Python 3.x was chosen to do so in the most easy way I could've imagined.
                        Yet it's not currently sufficient, it still plays a certain role in my life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's not aimed to replace any of existing Python 3.x based LISP interpreters,
                        it's aimed to bring myself into a some sort of programming experiments every day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I couldn't promise that one day this language will be mature enough to use it as
                        a complete Python 3.x alternative.
                        I could only promise to myself to not abandon this project.
                        And always push myself not just implement interpreter itself, grow syntax and runtime,
                        but test it, write something useful, because that is how languages become mature ones!
